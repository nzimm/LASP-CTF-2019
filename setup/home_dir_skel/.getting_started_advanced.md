# Advanced LASP shell & Linux training, Summer 2019
If you found this early, congrats - now go beat the first level set!
Otherwise, feel free to read on for info regarding the advanced levels.


## Advanced Levels
These levels are more advanced, focused on application security. Even if you've
taken a computer systems course, I'd recommend brushing up on buffer overflows.
All the target binaries are compiled with the following flags, unless specified
`-m32 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -fno-stack-protector`

It's dense and long, but still one of the best explanations of overflows:

Ask lots of questions, use Google, and be persistent - sucsessful exploits can
take a lot of hard work, but the payoff is incredible.
