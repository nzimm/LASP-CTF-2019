# LASP shell & Linux training, Summer 2019
## Getting started
Welcome! Now that you've got access to the training machine, what's next?


### Levels
All of the level information is stored at the `/ctf/` directory. Each level
contains an `objective` to get you started.

Ask lots of questions, use Google, and don't stress out - if you decide this
isn't your jam, feel free to stop after the cutoff.


### Administrative reccomendations
These are all optional:

1.  Change your password - stay away from reusing important passwords.
    After all, this machine is filled with vulnerable software, and if
    something goes wrong, you don't want to leak your bank password!
    You can change passwords by running the `passwd` command.

2.  SSH keys - this lets you log onto the machine without using a password.
    It's not mandatory, but it can make your life easier here, and when jumping
    between hosts on the LASP network. This link should help you get started:

3.  Get comfortable with Vim (or nano) while - not a requirement, editing
    files without a GUI is pretty important for working with headless systems.
    Nano easier to learn, but Vim has more extensive features and plugins.
