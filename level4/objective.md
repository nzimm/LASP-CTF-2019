# Level4 - tricking locally-resolved paths
For this level, you'll need to 'trick' this script into reading the password
file for you.

This level is a step up - you're not in the big leagues yet, but you'll need a
more intimate understanding of Linux and shell subtleties.

## Potentially useful commands
ln - create a link between files (symbolic links are most common)

## Tips
- this is the first level where you'll really need to think like an attacker.
  instead of reading the script how the author intended, look for ways to
  exploit it
