# Level5 - tricking locally-resolved paths
For this level, you'll need to 'trick' this script into doing something it's
not designed to do. This time there's no pass.txt file, and the binary isn't
going to level you up. You'll have to do that yourself!

This might not feel like much to go on, but the levels are going to start
getting less explicit - just remember, to move on you need to call the
`levelup` program with the current level's effective GID.

## Tips
- this is the first level where you'll really need to think like an attacker.
  open up the source code (it's super short) and look for anything funky that
  you can exploit.
