# Introductory CTF for LASP Summer 2019 training
Short CTF to teach introductory security concepts

## What is a CTF?
CTF stands for Capture The Flag. There are several styles of CTF, all of which
revolve around discovering and exploiting security holes in vulnerable software
to find *flags*. 

## What is a Flag?
In this CTF, each level will have a flag, which is the password for the next
level. Once you have discovered the flag for a level, you will be able to
advance to the next level.

## How do I advance?
TODO: will likely be a script that prompts you to input the flag you've found,
and then add you to a group for the next level.
