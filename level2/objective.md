# Level2 - file searching
There is a directory that contains several large data files. One of these files
has a human-readable password, which you'll need to move on to the next level.

## Useful commands
grep - your new best friend. You may want to try various flags so grep will
       print matching patterns

## Tips
- The password string is a 16 character hex string
- You may find more than one password contained within the data files, but only
  one is correct
