There is a directory that contains several large data files. One of these files
has a human-readable password, which you'll need to move on to the next level.

## Useful commands
grep - your new best friend. You may want to try various flags so grep will
       print matching patterns

## Tips

- You may find more than one suitable password contained within the data files,
  however only one will advance you to the next level
