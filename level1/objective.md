# Level 1
This level has two steps:
1) Create a new file in your home directory called `turnip.txt`, change the
   group to level0, and make the file executable. Run `level1` to check your
   work.
2) After completing step 1, you'll need to "lock down" your home directory so
   only your user account can access it. You won't need to modify owner/group
   for this step, only the permissions.
