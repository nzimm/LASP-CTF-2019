# Level 1
This level requires you to lock down your home directory. You don't want other
people to see your work!

## Useful commands
man   - eternally useful, type `man <command>` to open the manual
chmod - use `man chmod` to research the particular syntax you'll need

## Additional tips

## Leveling up
Run the `level1` program when you are ready to level up. There is no penalty
for running it multiple times, but once you've passed, you'll need to re-log
before you can start working on `level2`
