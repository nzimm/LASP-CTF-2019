# Level 0
In this level, you need to determine your default login shell. For help doing
this, you can either:
  1. google 'linux default login shell' and look for helpful solutions
  2. check out www.linuxjourney.com

## Leveling up
Run the `level0` program when you are ready to level up. There is no penalty
for running it multiple times, but once you've passed, you'll need to re-log
before you can start working on `level1`
